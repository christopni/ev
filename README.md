The main subject of this project is the management of the ev-charging stations network. We presume that the charging points are stationed in public or private areas, such as public parking areas, parking spots, gas stations, private parkings etc. The stakeholders that we examine in this particular project are the electronic vehicle owners, the energy providers, the parking owners as well as the municipalities that own public parking spaces. One or more use cases that we developed are assigned to each stakeholder. 
Car owners have the ability to charge their vehicles, to see the nearest available charging stations as well as to pay their past-due monthly bills. Parking owners and municipalities have access to statistics of their charging stations. Futhermore, they can add, delete or modify a charging spot. Finally, the energy providers can see statistics for all the chraging stations they provide electricity to.
