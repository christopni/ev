Then, open your command line and run:

2.

npm i npm-install
```
3.
```
npm install react-router-dom
```
4.
```
npm i axios
```
5.

npm install --save react-chartjs-2 chart.js
```
6.
```
npm install --save react-map-gl
```
7.
```
npm i react-select
```
8.

```

Now, run the following instructions ("my-app" is the name of your application):

```
npx create-react-app my-app
```
```
cd my-app
```
```
npm start
```

Finally, in the created folder replace the files that are the same with the ones included in the front-end folder of this repository.
